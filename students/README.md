# Course exercises

## First steps

1. Create a directory named using the initials of your surname(s) and first name(s) under the `exercises` directory (in lower-case letters). 
   For example, I (Hannu Parviainen) would create a directory `ph`.
3. Create subdirectories `sandbox`, `course_exercise_1` and `course_exercise_2` under this directory.
4. Create empty README.md files under the course exercise directories.
5. Create a subdirectory for each lecture under the sandbox directory. The directory name should be `lxx`, where x is a two-digit lecture 
   number (so that lecture 1 is `l01`, lecture 2 is `l02`, and so on). These subdirectories will contain your non-scored exercises and can 
   be created during the lectures.
  
Now, after the second lecture, your directory tree should look like:
  
    students
    |- ph
    ||- sandbox
    |||- l01
    |||- l02
    ||- course_exercise_1
    |||- README.md
    ||- course_exercise_2
    |||- README.md

4. Edit this README.md file to include your name and the name of the directory you created under the "Students" section below.
5. Stage all the README.md files using `git add` and commit the changes using `git commit`.
6. Push the changes to GitHub using `git push`.
7. In GitHub, open a pull request telling me you have reached this far.
